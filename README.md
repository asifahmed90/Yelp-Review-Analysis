# Yelp-Review-Analysis

Analysis between four different topologies of deep learning are done in Keras platform for the review database. Star ratings are predicted based on Review. The topologies are:

(i) MLP
(ii) Vanilla RNN
(iii) GRU 
(iv) Bidirectional RNN

However, 1D CNN model can also be implemented. 

To run the code initially first 100000 rows are chosen from Yelp Review Dataset.
